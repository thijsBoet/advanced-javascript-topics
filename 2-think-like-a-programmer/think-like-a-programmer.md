# Think like a Programmer

When exploring a future project. Always research Libraries and Frameworks that can help you accomplish this project, faster, better and more efficient.

DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL!

Keep up to date with Libraries/Frameworks, but never at the expense of pure JS. Focus on the fundamentals.

javascripting.com is a great resource about JS Libraries and Frameworks.
